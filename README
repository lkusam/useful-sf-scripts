## Run Anonymous APEX in Batch style

This is useful when you need to run a Anonymous APEX but similar to Batch Jobs but don't want to write a full APEX class and handle it ? This will help.

### How it works:

This uses a simple shell script where you provide the number of seconds it needs to sleep and number of time the APEX script needs to be executed and vola!! That's it.

### How to run it

1. A org is authenticated using the Salesforce CLI.
2. Download the repo using `Git Clone` or the shell script
3. Give permission to execute the shell script using `chmod +x script.sh` for **MAC or Linux** for **Windows** using the Powershell `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
4. You need to have you APEX script that does the DML in the `./apex` folder. Please refer to `test.apex` as sample.
5. Update the Sheel variables with your prefrences
   1. Num of Runs
   2. Sleep Timer
   3. Org Alias
   4. Script Path ( This is relative to folder)

6. Execute the script using the terminal `./runapexfile.sh`
